# PSNDealsScraper
A web scraper for the Playstation store deals page. Currently doesn't work since playstation website has started using javascript to load game titles,prices ect.

Uses tabulate to export tables into neater and more readable entries as well as beautifulsoup for page data extraction

Previous entries can be found in the whilmore/PSNDeals repo and heres an example below
